1# Bazel iOS Objective-C Project (No Storyboard)

This repository serves as a foundational example of an iOS application built using Bazel 7. It is configured for a pure, programmatic UI approach using Objective-C, completely bypassing the use of Storyboards.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the basic setup and configuration required to get a Bazel-driven iOS project up and running. It covers:

*   **Bazel Build Configuration:** A `BUILD.bazel` file set up for an iOS application, including library dependencies, app icon integration, and asset catalog management.
*   **Programmatic UI:** The application entry point is handled in the `SceneDelegate`, creating the `UIWindow` and setting the root view controller entirely through code.
*   **Objective-C Source:** All application logic is written in Objective-C.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of using Bazel for iOS development, especially for those who prefer a code-centric approach over visual interface builders.

## Getting Started

### Building the Application

To build the application directly from the command line, use the `bazel build` command:

```bash
bazel build //:my-app
```

This command compiles the source code and bundles the application into a `.app` file, which you can find in the `bazel-bin` directory.

### Generating the Xcode Project

To work with the project in Xcode, you first need to generate the `.xcodeproj` file. Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
bazel run //:xcode-project
```

This will create the `MyAwesomeApp.xcodeproj` file, which you can open in Xcode to browse, edit, and run the application.

**Note on Xcode's DerivedData:** If you make changes to the Bazel build files (`BUILD.bazel`, `.bazelrc`, etc.), you may need to regenerate the Xcode project. While Xcode has its own cache (`DerivedData`), Bazel has a separate cache. If you suspect caching issues, it's often more effective to clean the Bazel cache (see below) and regenerate the Xcode project.

### Cleaning the Build Cache

If you encounter any build issues or want to ensure a completely clean build, you can use the `bazel clean` command with the `--expunge` flag:

```bash
bazel clean --expunge
```

This command removes all build artifacts, cached objects, and other temporary files generated by Bazel, ensuring that the next build starts from a clean slate.

## Advanced Usage: Manual Installation and Debugging

For a more advanced workflow that bypasses the Xcode build system entirely, you can manually install the app on a simulator and attach the debugger.

1.  **Build the app:**
    ```bash
    bazel build //:my-app
    ```

2.  **Install the app on the simulator:**
    Drag and Drop the .app file (some where in /bazel-out directory) into simulator 

3.  **Launch the app:**
    Open the xcproject file and run the project. It will automaticallyattach to debugger as usual.
